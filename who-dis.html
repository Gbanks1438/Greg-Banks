      <ul>
      <li>I'm currently a Communictions Specialist for a Smart Home company.</li>
      <li>My responsabilities include maintaining our wiki documentation for supported devices in addition to managing the blog and social media pages.</li>
      <li>I've been using snippits of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for years with only a basic underatanding of how it worked within the framework of the DOM.</li>
      <li>I enrolled in the program for Software Engineering because I'd like to jump start to a new carrer path.</li>
      <li>My ultimate goal is to sharpen my coding skills and make a full transition to a Jr. Software Developer role.</li>
      <li>I found the pre-coursework to be very engaging and it helped me formalize my knowledge about coding.</li>
      <li>The coolest thing so far is knowing that I actualy designed all this from scratch by myself.</li>
      <li>I've always been a geek and playing around with different equipment helped me learn how things worked.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Silly me, I should have know it was just as much fun to learn coding the exact same way!</li>
<ul>
<li>I've been taking apart, reorganizing, and rebuilding the code for this site the same as I would to something mechanical.</li>
