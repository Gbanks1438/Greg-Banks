          <h1>About Me</h1>
      </main>
      <ul>
      <li>I'm currently a Communications Specialist for a Smart Home company.</li>
      <li>I graduated with a B.A. in English, but I have used my language skills to build a career focused on technology.</li>
      <li>My responsibilities include maintaining our wiki documentation for supported devices, managing the blog, and managing the social media pages.</li>
      <li>I've been using snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for years with only a basic understanding of how it worked within the framework of the DOM.</li>
      <li>I enrolled in the program for Software Engineering because I'd like to jump-start a new career path.</li>
      <li>My ultimate goal is to sharpen my coding skills and transition to a Jr. Software Developer role.</li>
      <li>I found the pre-coursework to be very engaging. It helped me formalize my knowledge about coding.</li>
      <li>I'm amazed by how much I had managed to self-learn over the last few years, and now it's finally making sense!</li>
      <li>The coolest thing about this experience so far is knowing that I designed all this from scratch by myself.</li>
      <li>I've always been a geek. Playing around with different equipment and taking it apart helped me learn how things worked.</li>
      <li>I love using power tools, working on cars, woodworking, building PCs, and I'm also an outdoor enthusiast.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>I should have known it was just as much fun to learn to code the same way!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I've been taking apart, reorganizing, and rebuilding the code for this site the same as I would to something mechanical.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>My weapons are the wrench, the pen, and now the keyboard.</li>
